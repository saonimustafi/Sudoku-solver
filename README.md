# Sudoku-Solver using Java

To enter the values of the sudoku you want to solve, just modify the grid variable inside the main function of any of the files (sudokuBacktrack.java, sudokuForwardCheck.java or sudokuMRV.java) and then run that Java file.

All the three Java programs mentioned above are able to solve a hard level sudoku efficiently using a variety of techniques - backtracking, forward checking, and constraint propagation using minimum remaining value (MRV) respectively. A single approach is followed in a single file. The files are named according to the algorithms used.
